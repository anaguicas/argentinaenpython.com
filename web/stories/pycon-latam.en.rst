This year at PyCon USA, a group of ~10 people organized an open space
to talk about the idea of PyCon Latam and share experiences about
different PyCon in different counties. There were present people from
MÃ©xico, Argentina, Dominic Republic, Uruguay, Colombia and more.

At that time, we decided to share emails and start talking about this
but finally we didn't advance too much on this topic. In fact, we
didn't even decide the way of communication that we were going to
use. Finally, we arrange that the most suitable place for this would
be an Slack channel inside the PSF official Slack:
https://thepsf.slack.com

Anyway, nothing happened.

Some time after that, I travelled to `Python Brasil[13]
<http://2017.pythonbrasil.org.br/>`_ and many people asked me "When
are we going to have a PyCon Latam?" and I said, "Hey many people is
interested on start talking on this. Give me your email and I will try
to make all of you to communicate each other."

A couple of days after this, *Vandy BoBandy* tweeted this and exploded:

Finally, I asked Ewa (director of operations at PSF) and she gave me
green light to create this Slack channel under the official PSF
Slack. So, at this moment I'm collecting the list of emails of the
people interested on make this amazing idea happen to send her the
list in the next week(s) to open this channel and finally make it
happen :)

I hope you join us (by sending an email to argentinaenpython@gmail.com
or Twitter Direct Message to @argenpython) and we can work together to
make this dream a reality.
